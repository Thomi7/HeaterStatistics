# HeaterStatistics
As the description states this repo is very specific and will probably only work with one or more specific heater systems.
It rather serves as a basic example of how to make displaying data of an UDP broadcast of any kind in the web possible.
In an optimal case you only have to modify the Progam.cs in the HeaterListener directory to process the stream correctly.
